## personal project

* **Lotte_CBA** is a project using customer data from the Lotte Competition. This project recommend personal products to each customer individually by analyzing recommmendation system, and offer services for store management. 

* **LAWS** is the thesis presented in a *large-scale inference (spring, 2021)* in  UOS. 

The presentation is a summary of the paper *Cai, T. T., Sun, W., & Xia, Y. (2021). LAWS: A locally adaptive weighting and screening approach to spatial multiple testing. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 1-14.* I learned from the book *Efron, B. (2012). Large-scale inference: empirical Bayes methods for estimation, testing, and prediction (Vol. 1). Cambridge University Press.*

* **fusion** is the final-project presented in a *Multivariate statistics (autumn, 2021)* in UOS. 

The presentation is a summary of the paper *Stokell, B. G., Shah, R. D., & Tibshirani, R. J. (2021). Modelling high‚Äêdimensional categorical data using nonconvex fusion penalties. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Statistical Methodology), 83(3), 579-611.* I learned from the book *Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., Friedman, J. H., & Friedman, J. H. (2009). The elements of statistical learning: data mining, inference, and prediction (Vol. 2, pp. 1-758). New York: springer.*

* **AISR** is the final-project presented in a *Topics in statistics (autumn, 2021)* in  UOS. 

As an application of Importance Sampling, the Importance Sampling method was used to estimate the probability of rare events in regression analysis. I learned from the book *Rubinstein, R. Y., & Kroese, D. P. (2016). Simulation and the Monte Carlo method. John Wiley & Sons.*
